					<h2 id="st-louis">Saint Louis, MO</h2>
					<p>Here it is! Born and raised! Here is where I spent most of my life and it is where I currently live. I have family scattered around the US, but most of them are here in the STL. I have a LOT of memories here that I will cherish for life.</p>

					<h2>Saint Charles, MO</h2>
					<p>After me and my wife got married, We moved into our first apartment right in what people call the heart of St. Charles. We spent 2 years in St. Charles and it was a great place to stay. We were less than 10 mins away from places we loved to go and a rock throw away from the casino. But due to work relocations, we moved back to St. Louis.</p>

						<h4>Osaka, Japan</h4>
                        <p>As a kid I watched a show called "Abenobashi: Magical Shopping Arcade". Its about two kids from Osaka and they went on this crazy adventure because of an adorable alien and they were trying very hard to get back home.</p>
                        <p>But every episode when they thought they were home, the alien placed them an another reality of home. I watched this alot growing up and I felt like I went on the adventure with them and always wanted to live there. So I tell alot of people that I lived there as a joke.</p>
                        <p>Osaka is known in japan as "Tenka no daidokoro" or "The country's kitchen" because it is known as the place to go to get great food. Alot of people think that Osaka is an ordinary city but if you ask me, I think Osaka is a lot like St. Louis</p>
